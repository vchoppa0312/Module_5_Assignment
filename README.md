## API and MC Simulation

The focus of the challenge is Financial Planning and Retirement Planning. The Jupyter Notebook framework provided for analysis is used to code various blocks as part of the challenge.

The first part of the challenge is to use requests library to capture crypto prices and Alpaca APIs to capture stock and bonds prices to create a portfolio of savings to analyze health of the savings for emergency funds.

In the second part, MCForecastTools1.py is used to conduct MonteCarlo Simulation for Retirement Analysis. Initially a 30-year period is choosen to run MonteCarlo simulation to analyse lower and upper bounds at 95% confidence levels. Further an early retirement analysis with a higher stock to bond weightage and higher initial investment is used to conduct a 5-Year and 10-Year simulation.
